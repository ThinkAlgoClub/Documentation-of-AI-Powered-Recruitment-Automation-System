## üß† Project Title: AI-Based Recruitment Automation System

---

### üìù Project Goal:

We need to **build a system that helps companies hire the best candidates** automatically using AI. This system will read job descriptions and resumes, compare them, rank the best candidates, and even reach out to them ‚Äî all with minimal human work.

---

### üéØ What the System Should Do (Step-by-Step):

1. **Understand the Job Description**

   * The system should read a job posting and extract what the company is looking for ‚Äî like required **skills**, **experience**, and **qualifications**.

2. **Read and Analyze Resumes**

   * The system should automatically read resumes and **compare them with the job description**.
   * It will give each resume a **score** showing how good the match is.

3. **Recommend Best Candidates**

   * Based on the scores, the system will **suggest the top candidates** to interview.

4. **Find Candidates from Job Portals (e.g., Monster)**

   * If no one applies, the system will **search online** job portals to find good candidates and **pull their data**.

5. **Send Emails or Messages Automatically**

   * The system will send **automated messages or emails** to the selected candidates, asking if they‚Äôre interested in the job.

### üß© How We'll Build It (Modules to Work On):

#### 1. Resume & Job Description Analyzer (AI + NLP)

* Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract details from resumes and job descriptions.
* Tools: `spaCy`, `OpenAI`, `Scikit-learn`
* Extract: Skills, experience, education, job titles
* Match resumes with job descriptions and **calculate a score**.

#### 2. Candidate Ranking System

* Create a system to **score and rank candidates**.
* Ranking will depend on:

  * Skills match (hard and soft skills)
  * Years of experience and job role
  * Education and certifications
  * Keyword match between resume and job description

#### 3. Find Candidates from Monster (If No Applications)

* Use **APIs** (if available) or **web scraping** tools to collect profiles from Monster.com.
* Filter those profiles using our job matching logic.
* Tools: `Selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`

#### 4. Interview Scheduling & Pre-screening

* Send interview invites to selected candidates automatically.
* Can integrate with tools like **Calendly** or **Google Calendar**.
* Optional: Use a chatbot to ask simple screening questions.

#### 5. Simple Dashboard (User Interface)

* A web app where users can:

  * Upload resumes
  * View ranked candidates
  * See AI suggestions
  * Manually adjust or override selections
