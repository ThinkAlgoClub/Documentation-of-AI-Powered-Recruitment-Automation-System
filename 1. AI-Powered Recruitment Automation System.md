# **AI-Powered Recruitment Automation System**  

## **Project Overview**  
We are building an AI-powered system to automate the recruitment process. The system will:  

1. **Understand Job Descriptions** – Extract key skills, experience, and qualifications.  
2. **Analyze Resumes** – Compare resumes with job descriptions and rank candidates.  
3. **Recommend the Best Candidates** – Select top profiles based on AI scoring.  
4. **Search for Candidates on Job Portals** – If no one applies, automatically find and extract top profiles from Monster.  
5. **Automate Candidate Outreach** – Send emails/messages to shortlisted candidates.

## **System Breakdown & Features**  

### **1. Resume Parsing & Analysis (AI & NLP)**  
- Use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to extract structured data from resumes.  
- Extract key details like **skills, experience, education, and job titles**.  
- Compare each resume with the job description and assign a **relevance score**.  
- Use tools like **spaCy, OpenAI embeddings, or TensorFlow** for AI processing.  

### **2. Candidate Ranking System**  
- Develop a **scoring algorithm** based on:  
  - **Skill Matching** (Technical + Soft Skills)  
  - **Experience Level** (Years, Industry, Role)  
  - **Education & Certifications**  
  - **Keyword Matching Percentage**  
  - **Company Reputation (Optional)**  
- AI will prioritize the **best-matching candidates** automatically.  

### **3. Auto-Profile Scanning from Monster**  
- If no candidates apply, the system will **search job portals** like Monster.  
- **APIs or Web Scraping** (using Selenium, Scrapy, or BeautifulSoup) will extract candidate profiles.  
- AI will **filter these profiles** based on job requirements.  

### **4. Interview Scheduling & Automation**  
- The system will send **automated interview invites** to shortlisted candidates.  
- It will integrate with **Google Calendar, Outlook, or Calendly** for scheduling.  
- An **AI chatbot** will conduct an initial Q&A screening with candidates.  

### **5. Dashboard & User Interface**  
- A **simple web application** where users can:  
  - Upload resumes  
  - View ranked candidates  
  - Get AI recommendations  
  - Manually override AI selections
