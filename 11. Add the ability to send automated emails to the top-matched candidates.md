âœ… Letâ€™s now **add the ability to send automated emails to the top-matched candidates** after the resumes have been analyzed.

## âœ… Step: Send Automated Emails to Top Candidates After Matching

Weâ€™ll use Djangoâ€™s built-in email framework to send these emails.

---

### âœ… Step 1: Configure Email Settings

### ðŸ“„ File: `recruitment_ai/settings.py`

Add the following SMTP settings (example using Gmail SMTP):

```python
# Email configuration (replace with actual credentials)
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
```

> ðŸ”’ **Important**: Donâ€™t hardcode credentials in production. Use environment variables or Django settings management like `python-decouple`.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Create Function to Send Email

### ðŸ“„ File: `core/utils.py`

Create this file if it doesnâ€™t exist:

```bash
touch core/utils.py
```

Add:

```python
from django.core.mail import send_mail

def send_invitation_email(candidate_name, candidate_email, job_title):
    subject = f"Interview Invitation for {job_title}"
    message = f"""
    Hi {candidate_name},

    Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the role of {job_title}.
    
    We would like to schedule an interview with you. Please reply to this email with your availability.

    Regards,
    Recruitment Team
    """
    from_email = 'your_email@gmail.com'
    recipient_list = [candidate_email]

    send_mail(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list)
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Modify Resume Matching View to Send Emails

### ðŸ“„ File: `core/views.py`

Add this import:

```python
from .utils import send_invitation_email
```

Update the `match_resumes` function at the end:

```python
# Send email to top 3 candidates
top_candidates = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)[:3]

for candidate in top_candidates:
    send_invitation_email(candidate['candidate_name'], candidate['email'], job.title)
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Allow Less Secure Apps (Gmail Only)

Go to: [https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)

Or use an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for higher security.

---

### âœ… Step 5: Restart Server

If the server was running, restart it to load the new settings:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### âœ… Step 6: Test Email Sending

Go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/
```

Enter a valid job ID and click **Match**. Emails will automatically be sent to the top 3 candidates (if valid email IDs are in the database).
