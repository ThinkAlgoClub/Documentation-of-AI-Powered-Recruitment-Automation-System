✅ Now we’ll move to the **next step: Integrate interview scheduling automation**.

We'll automate sending interview invites using [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) or a simple Google Calendar link in the email.

---

## ✅ Step: Integrate Interview Scheduling in Email (Manual or Calendly-based)

---

### ✅ Step 1: Register or Prepare a Scheduling Link

#### Option 1: Use [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)

* Sign up at: [https://calendly.com/](https://calendly.com/)
* Set up a new Event (e.g., “30-Minute Interview”).
* Copy the generated **Calendly link** (e.g., `https://calendly.com/yourname/interview-slot`).

#### Option 2: Use Google Calendar Link (basic)

Use this template (replace placeholders):

```text
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit?text=Interview+with+Recruiter&dates=20250509T090000Z/20250509T093000Z&details=Interview+scheduled+with+you&location=Google+Meet&sf=true
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Update Email Function

📄 **File:** `core/utils.py`

Modify `send_invitation_email()` to include the scheduling link.

Replace the existing `message` with:

```python
message = f"""
Hi {candidate_name},

Congratulations! You have been shortlisted for the role of {job_title}.

We would like to schedule an interview with you.

Please select a convenient time using the link below:
https://calendly.com/yourname/interview-slot

We look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,  
Recruitment Team
"""
```

> Replace `https://calendly.com/yourname/interview-slot` with your actual Calendly link or Google Calendar link.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add Interview Scheduling Log (Optional)

📄 **File:** `core/models.py`

```python
class InterviewSchedule(models.Model):
    candidate = models.ForeignKey(Candidate, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    job = models.ForeignKey(Job, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    email_sent = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    sent_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations core
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### ✅ Step 4: Update `match_resumes` to Log Emails Sent

📄 **File:** `core/views.py`

After sending the email:

```python
InterviewSchedule.objects.create(
    candidate=Candidate.objects.get(email=candidate['email']),
    job=job,
    email_sent=True
)
```

> Make sure to `import InterviewSchedule` and `Candidate` at the top:

```python
from .models import InterviewSchedule, Candidate
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: Test It All Together

1. Upload resumes.
2. Match candidates.
3. Emails will include a link for scheduling the interview.

---

✅ **Done:** You now have resume matching + candidate email invite + interview scheduling link all automated.
